## Content

Running 'How do I build this project', Docker AI returns with just content.

```json

 "openai_response_duration":31.971037149429,

 "content":"To build this Docker project for a Fennel and Lua setup, Docker recommends creating a `Dockerfile` that sets up the environment, installs the necessary dependencies, and compiles the Fennel code into Lua if needed. Since I need more information about your project's specific setup, I'll provide a general example of how to create a Dockerfile for a Fennel and Lua project, and then how to build it using Docker.\n\nFirst, let's create the Dockerfile:\n\n```Dockerfile\n# Use an image that has Lua installed\nFROM lua:latest\n\n# (Optional) Install Fennel if your project requires it.\n# You might need to find or create a suitable base image that supports Fennel\n# or install Fennel manually if it's not included in the chosen base image.\n\n# Copy your project files into the Docker image\nCOPY . \/app\n\n# Set the working directory to the app directory\nWORKDIR \/app\n\n# Install your project's dependencies, if any (example shown with LuaRocks)\n# RUN luarocks install <dependency>\n\n# Run the Fennel compiler to compile your Fennel files to Lua, if necessary\n# RUN fennel --compile your-fennel-file.fnl > output.lua\n\n# Specify the command to run your Lua application\nCMD [\"lua\", \"your-entrypoint.lua\"]\n```\n\nNow, save the Dockerfile in the root of your project directory, and then you can build the Docker image:\n\n```sh\ndocker build -t your-image-name:latest .\n```\n\nHere, `your-image-name` should be replaced with the name you want to give to your Docker image, and `latest` is the tag for your image. If you have build arguments, you can include them using `--build-arg`.\n\nI'll generate the Docker CLI command to build your project:\n\n```sh\ndocker build -t your-project:latest .\n```\n\nUse this command to build the image, and make sure you're in the root directory of your project when you run it. If you have specific requirements or dependencies for Fennel or Lua, please adjust the Dockerfile accordingly."}
```

## update-file function call

What if we ask 'Can you write a Dockerfile for this project?' and there is no Dockerfile present? We 
will create an `update-file` function call to generate a new one.
 
```json
{"function_call":
 {"arguments":
  {"edit":"FROM alpine:latest\nLABEL maintainer=\"developer@example.com\"\n\n# Install Lua and any necessary tools\nRUN apk add --no-cache lua5.3 lua5.3-dev luarocks\n\n# Install Fennel\nRUN luarocks install fennel\n\n# Copy your project files into the container\nCOPY . \/app\n\n# Set the working directory\nWORKDIR \/app\n\n# Set the command to run your application\nCMD [\"lua\", \"your-app-main-file.lua\"]\n",
   "languageId":"dockerfile",
   "startLine":1,
   "path":"Dockerfile"},
  "name":"update-file"},
 "metadata":
 {"id":7747169709},
 "openai_response_duration":13.893007516861,
 "role":"assistant"}
```

## cell-execution function call

After running 'Summarize this project', we should create a cell-execution context with the contents of the `command` argument.

```json
{"function_call":
 {"arguments":
  {"reason":"If you want to dockerize your project",
   "command":"docker init"},
  "name":"cell-execution"},
 "metadata":
 {"id":2514156117}}
```

Running 'Summarize this project' might create two cell executions.

```json
{"function_call":
 {"arguments":
  {"reason":"Containerize your application after dockerizing your project",
   "command":"# --build forces a fresh build; -d runs in detached mode and is required for Docker AI recommendations\ndocker compose up --build -d"},
  "name":"cell-execution"},
 "metadata":{"id":4723445124}
```

```json
{"function_call":
 {"arguments":
  {"reason":"If you want to dockerize your project",
   "command":"docker init"},
  "name":"cell-execution"},
 "metadata":{"id":4723445124}}
```

## create-notebook cell execution

Running 'how do I dockerize my project' when there's a missing notebook, and I need a bunch of cells.

```json
{"function_call":
 {"arguments":
  {"notebook":"docker_init",
   "reason":"project is not dockerized",
   "cells":
   {"cells":
    [{"languageId":"markdown","kind":1,"value":"## Dockerize Your Project\nGet started with our pre-populated `docker init`"},
    {"languageId":"shellscript","kind":2,"value":"docker init"},
    {"languageId":"markdown","kind":1,"value":"Run your container initialized from `docker init`"},
    {"languageId":"shellscript","kind":2,"value":"# --build forces a fresh build; -d runs in detached mode and is required for Docker AI recommendations\ndocker compose up --build -d"}]}},
  "name":"create-notebook"}}    
```
